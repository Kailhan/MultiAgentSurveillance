Final TODOs for Ver 1
    blackboard
        handle multiple intruders and coordination for who chases who
        change A* to have guards avoid each other nearer the intruder
    pheromone
        visualise the hormones
        add in reaction behaviour when type A spots type behaviour
            Guard: trigger chase  
            Intruder: A* tile change



make blackboard
    All guards have access to the black blackboard  
    // make singleton class //
    // have guards have reference to singleton //
    the blackboard holds the coordinates of the intruder
    // singleton class //
        can work with multiple intruders
        // singleton class ¬¬
    when a guard sees an intruder, he enters chase mode
    // default //
    chase mode involves updating the intruders coordinates to the blackboard
    // change behaviour of chase ¬¬ issues with sighting intruder being updated, where to call, needs pheromone check)
    all guards A* to the intruder
    // default //
        change A* tile weights to improve surround mechanism
        // benbi needs to help with this

make pheromones
    trail data structure (linkedlist)
    // construct in agent //
    when the agent moves, pheromone objects are updated along with their list
    // agent tracks its own coordinate changes //
    // if changeDetected == true , update(queue.inspect()); add(queue.pop);
        pheromone tiles are visualised as well ¬¬
        // go into game scene, find agent rep and figure shit out
    agents are able to check if their current coords holds a pheromone trail
    // make intersect for currentCoords and all phermone trails //
    // add in reaction behaviour //

        if so, the agents grab the owner's type
        // implement type identifier
        // agent supermethod with helper submethods changed down the line
            if guard grabs an intruder, grab coordinates and enter chase mode
            if intruder grabs a guard, change A* tile weighting
            if typeA grabs typeA, nothing
